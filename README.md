# Image_Outpainting

# Implicit-Neural-Representations

### Implemented simple feedforward network to compress the image 
### Initial model Results:-
- Reported PSNR 27.7
- Groung truth(left image) with the reconstruction image (right):-

### Improved model by using positional encoding
-  Reported PSNR 29.2 and better reconstruction
- Comparison of initial and Improved model with each other and ground truth:-
